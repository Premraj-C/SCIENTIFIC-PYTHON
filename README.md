# üß† Premraj's work;

Welcome to my growing collection of Python solvers built for simulating classical physics problems using numerical methods like **Euler Forward** and **Runge-Kutta**. These codes are a part of my self-driven journey into **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** and **Scientific Computing**, where I combine core physics intuition with numerical muscle to simulate real-world systems.

üî¨ What's Inside?

This repository currently includes:
- üü° **Ball Dropped in a visocus Fluid**  
  Simulates the vertical motion of a ball falling under gravity through a resistive fluid medium. Captures drag forces, velocity decay, and eventual rest.
  
- üü† **Mass-Spring-Dashpot System**  
  Solves the second-order ODEs governing a damped harmonic oscillator using various time-stepping schemes.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Euler Forward & Runge-Kutta Solvers**  
  Cleanly implemented from scratch for solving first and second-order ordinary differential equations. Easy to extend to more complex systems.

üß≠ Why This Repository?

This space is my numerical physics lab. I'm building a foundation of solver code which I will eventually use to:
- Simulate **complex fluid flow** using the **Navier-Stokes equations**
- Implement **finite difference**, **finite volume**, and **spectral methods**
- Explore **fluid-structure interaction (FSI)** and **data-driven physics (ML + CFD)**
- Test out **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** for solving PDEs

Whether you're a student, researcher, or just a curious mind, feel free to explore and contribute. This is just the beginning.
